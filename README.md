# Decision Tree Classification

Exploring decision trees to predict a categorical variable. 

The decision tree classifier uses the entropy criterion to optimize class definition in each leaf, or node, of the tree.
The prediction regions and boundaries (or decision tree splits) can be visualized to view the model's test and training set results. *Note* that decision tree classifiers are not algorithms based on Eucilidean distance, so features are generally not scaled; however, for the visualization in this notebook, feautres are indeed scaled to prevent a memory error.
